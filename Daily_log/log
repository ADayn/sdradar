Work Log


--June 6, 2018--
Achievements:
-Visualize IQ data with gnuRadio
-We can TX pulses and sine wave
-We RX those pulses and waves and visualize them with gnuRadio to confirm

Lessons:
Switch computers to solve:
Bladerf_get_timestamp ERROR -5 File/device I/o error

-RADAR (better lower case radar)
order of thing: sample, correlate, decimate, fft
pulses are best with 7bit barker
range-doppler-map is the same as CAF (cross ambiguity function)
In Foundations of Radar Signal Processing section 3.1.3 has all the functions!

Sample-rate is the width of the channel that the sdr samples

Todo:
-Record samples before TX to compare to RX.
-Fix siggen.py by looking through Dan's code.
-Take measurements for Soapy now that it's working.
-Do RX and TX in libBladeRF.
-Look at c code for Soapy.
